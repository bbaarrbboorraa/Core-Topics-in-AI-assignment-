The chatbot is implemented using an open-source LLM ([GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/gpt2)), fine-tuned using the [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) method. The data used to fine-tune this chatbot was the open-source [transcripts of Donald Trump's speeches](https://github.com/alexmill/trump_transcripts).
